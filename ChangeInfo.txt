//
// What is Changed in this version (1.5.2)
//
// New-Features:
// Register Password is now doing auto confirm.
//   so, if player is using a space in the registered password treats it as the
//   player typed it in twice as a sort of  confirm option. So the registered password 
//   containing a space should have the same first and second part. This also implies 
//   that now it is impossible to register a password containing a space character.
//   If there is no space then the typed password is set as the registered password.
// Added BCRYPT as password encryption (configurable in config.yml).
//   If players Registers of changes his password it will be stored using the 
//   Encryption Method configured in the config.yml config file.
// Added setrecover command so players can recover their forgotten password using
//   Quesion+Answer when they have not set their email address. Password recover 
//   using email has priority over Question+Answer. If a player has set his email 
//   address then the player cannot set the recovery Quesion+Answer. 
// You have now full control over the command Aliases this plugin uses,
//   just by editing the alias entries in the plugin.yml file in the jar file.
// GodeMode On Join if WithInSession  (Grace-periode Disconnect/Connect) Enable/Disabled using config setting
// This could be (mis)used as a pvp exploit (previous: disconnect+connect activated godmode) 
//
// Bug-Fix
//
// fixed the "AmkMcAuth' about their usage of System.out/err.print. Please use your plugin's logger instead" message
// fixed the amkauth.requirelogin permission bug, amkmcauth was not using this permission and always asked to
// 	register and/or login. Now, if you set the global require (login to play) to false you can use your permission
//	plugin to check on certain players(groups) to having this permission to force register and/or login.
